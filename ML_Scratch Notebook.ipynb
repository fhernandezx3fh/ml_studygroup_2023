    "even if your boyfriend or girlfriend is uninterested and the festival is hard to get to. \n",
    "But perhaps you really loathe bad weather, and there's no way you'd go to the festival if the weather is bad. \n",
    "You can use perceptrons to model this kind of decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is to choose a weight w1=6 for the weather, and w2=2 and w3=2 for the other conditions. \n",
    "The larger value of w1 indicates that the weather matters a lot to you, \n",
    "much more than whether your boyfriend or girlfriend joins you, or the nearness of public transit. \n",
